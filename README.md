Project in Web Dev A.Y. 2020-2021

This is an online student information system called Polytechnic University of the PUP (notice that it's a recursive definition, just like PHP) that took a lot of inspiration from the official PUP (Polytechnic University of the Philippines) Website. It records all information about the students that are enrolled in the University as well as the "admins" or the PUP instructors. You can either log-in as a student or as an admin, each with their own different interaction with the website. A student can enroll a subject and a professor, while an admin can edit grades for every student that is enrolled to that admin.

## Employs the ff:
  User Management - Each user can manage their account information
  Data Entry - A new account can be created but only for students. Also, A student can choose subjects to enroll.
  Search Module - There is page that allows the user to search the database, such as search student profile for admin
  Connection to Database - This website uses the phpmyadmin to manage data in the database. The language used is MySQL.
 
## Does not employ:
  Printing of information or saving to a file - Honestly, we just forgot.
